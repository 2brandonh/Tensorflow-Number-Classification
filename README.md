# Python-Tensorflow-Personal-Projects

Major thanks to sentdex's videos on Python programming for deeplearning using Tensorflow and Keras.

The first half of this code was written entirely by him in the tutorial videos. The personal comments are written by me on the side as I learned the topic. The latter half involved my integration of the program with a Tkinter library used to create a drawing application classifying numbers.
