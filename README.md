# Python-Tensorflow-Personal-Projects

Major thanks to sentdex's videos on Python programming for deeplearning using Tensorflow and Keras. The first half of this code was written entirely by him in the tutorial videos with my personal comments written on the side. The latter half involved my integration of the program with a Tkinter library used to create a drawing application classifying numbers.
