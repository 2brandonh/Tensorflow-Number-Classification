# Python-Tensorflow-Personal-Projects

Major thanks to sentdex's videos on Python programming for deeplearning using Tensorflow and Keras.

The first half of this code was written entirely by him in the tutorial videos. The personal comments are written by me on the side as I learned the topic. The latter half involved my integration of the program with a Tkinter library used to create a drawing application classifying numbers. Derek Banas's tutorial using the Tkinter library helped in creating a canvas for drawing numbers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE5kh02CkTY

The goal of this project was to learn how to implement Tensorflow and Keras to read numbers drawn on a computer. Step 1 was to first classify the MNIST dataset accurately. Step 2 was to create a drawing GUI that scaled images appropriately to grayscale, 28x28 for the model to use. Step 3 involved integrating both objectives to make a complete program.
